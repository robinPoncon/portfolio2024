		"answer-1": "I am seeking an opportunity as a product-oriented Frontend Engineer with a focus on UX. I enjoy working on complex web products, where the frontend is not limited to integration but plays a key role in understanding business needs and user experience. I want to work closely with product and technical teams to build reliable, maintainable and user-friendly applications, using React, Next.js and TypeScript in particular.",

It's this combination that allows me to express who I am and finally find a balance in my life!",
		"question-5": "Really interesting! And finally: Star Wars or Lord of the Rings?",
		"answer-5": "Lord of the Rings without hesitation! ‘I can read in your eyes the same fear that could seize my heart. A day may come when the courage of men fails and we abandon our friends. But that day has not come!’ Chills guaranteed ahah!"
